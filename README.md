# Bare Metal Template

This is some template code that could be useful to start learning bare metal.
I've used the Micro:bit V2 board as an example but as long as you override the nrf52833 specific sections you can adapt it to any arm board and MCU.
Adapting to another CPU architecture might be harder as you would need to also change the toolchain and the assembly examples will not be relevant.
